To use this you are going to need Node.Js

# Steps on how to use
Add the clothing a folder with the clothing dlcpack name as the folder into the stream folder

For example:
- *jbib_006_u.ydd*  
Would be the following if you did this manually:
- *mp_m_freemode_01_mp_m_sum^jbib_006_u.ydd*  
So when you create a folder name it the following:  
- *mp_m_freemode_01_mp_m_sum*  
And everything that belongs to *mp_m_freemode_01_mp_m_sum* put it into the folder like so:  
- *mp_m_freemode_01_mp_m_sum > jbib_006_u.ydd*
