To use this you are going to need Node.Js

# Steps on how to use
Add the clothing a folder with the clothing dlcpack name as the folder into the stream folder.  
Once thats done you need to open a command terminal in the folder with *index.js* in it and type the following into the console:  
- *node index.js*  
Then it should tell you once it's complete, simply close the program and drag the contents of the stream folder into your resource stream folder 

For example:
- *jbib_006_u.ydd*  
Would be the following if you did this manually:
- *mp_m_freemode_01_mp_m_sum^jbib_006_u.ydd*  
So when you create a folder name it the following:  
- *mp_m_freemode_01_mp_m_sum*  
And everything that belongs to *mp_m_freemode_01_mp_m_sum* put it into the folder like so:  
- *mp_m_freemode_01_mp_m_sum > jbib_006_u.ydd*

### It ain't much but its honest work
